![VISION Logo](https://neurostack.tech/logo.png)

**VISION** is an advanced computer vision project reimagined with Next.js, leveraging artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques to deliver diverse capabilities in image analysis and processing through a modern web interface.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Identify and classify objects in images with high accuracy.
- **Image Segmentation**: Separate different parts of an image for detailed analysis.
- **Face Recognition**: Detect and recognize individuals in images.
- **Scene Analysis**: Interpret and understand the overall content of images.
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Easy-to-use image upload functionality.
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant visual feedback of detection results.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neurostackai/VISION.git
   cd vision-nextjs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Drag and drop an image or click to select one
3. Wait for the automatic analysis to complete
4. View the detection results overlaid on your image

## Technologies Used

- Next.js for the web framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- TensorFlow.js for AI model inference
- COCO-SSD for object detection
- MediaPipe Face Detection for facial recognition
- Tailwind CSS for styling
